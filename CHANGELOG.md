- **IMPORTANT: Premium Versions now have License Keys**, if you already own the Premium Version you'll find your license key [here](https://drawingbotv3.com/my-account/license_keys/). If you purchase DBV3 Premium in the future you'll also receive this License Key with your Order Confirmation. More details [here](https://drawingbotv3.com/license-keys/).
- **IMPORTANT:** .jar versions of DBV3 will no longer be distributed, please use the dedicated Windows/Mac/Linux installers. This is to allow more advanced features which require specific Java versions, DBV3 now uses JAVA 19.
- Added: **13 NEW PFMS** -
  - **Sketch Sweeping Curves**: A new Sketch PFM focused on creating long sweeping curves which are more natural / human-like, focused on creating longer curves. It shares most setting with other Sketch PFMS.
    - 'Curvature': Controls the appearance of "knots" in the curve. It translates to spline types: 0 = Uniform Catmull-Rom, 0.5 = Centripetal Catmull-Rom (Default), 1.0 Chordal Catmull-Rom
  - **LBG Shapes, Triangulation, Tree, Stippling, Dashes, Letters, Diagram, TSP, Circular Scribbles** - LBS (Linde Buzo Gray) PFMs combine the speed of Adaptive PFMs with the Quality of Voronoi PFMs and in most cases will outperform both in detail retention. They also respond better to large variations in stipple spacing.
    - 'Stipple Radius Min/Max' - Controls the spacing of the stipple points, smaller stipple radii will result in more detailed results.-
    - 'Density' - Controls the tone of the resulting image, a low density will be low contrast and may lose detail when the min/max stipple radius are far apart, a high density will be high contrast and retain more detail but will result in longer plotting times.
    - 'Threshold' - Controls the luminance at which stipples will stop being placed, similar to "Ignore White" but with finer control.
    - 'Max Iteration' - The number of times the stipple points will be refined, far fewer iterations are required to get good results than with Voronoi PFMs
  - **LBG Quad Tiles**: An LBG PFM which currently has no Voronoi / Adaptive counterpart, this PFM draws a Quad Tree from the LBS Stippling points.
  - **ECS Drawing:** This PFM has three separate components **E**dge Detection,  **C**ontour Detection & **S**hading. Each component can be controlled independently, you can also run them individually and then combine ECS with other PFMs instead using PFM Layers.
    - 'Simplify' - Simplifies the Edges & Contours generated.
    - 'Draw Edges' - Disables/Enables edge detection.
    - 'Edge Blur' - Affects the pre-filter blur applied before edges are detected, higher edge blur will result in less edges but the edges will be smoother.
    - 'Edge Threshold' - Controls the amount of edges which are generated: lower threshold -> more edges : higher threshold -> less edges
    - 'Draw Contours' - Disables/Enables contour detection.
    - 'Contour Blur' - Similar to Edge Blur but for contours, has a greater impact on the amount of contours and quality of the contours.
    - 'Contour Detail' - Controls the amount of contours to be generated.
    - 'Draw Shading' - Disables/Enables shading. The shading component uses a simplified version of the Sketch Lines shading feature, you may choose to disable the shading entirely and overlay another Sketch PFM using PFM Layers.
    - 'Shading Threshold' - Controls the luminance at which shading will be stopped: lower -> less shading : higher -> more shading
    - 'Shading Detail' - Controls the accuracy of the shading: lower -> less accurate, more stylised : higher -> more accurate, less stylised
    - 'Shading Length' - Controls the maximum length of the lines which make up the shading.
  - **Pen Calibration:** This PFM is used for generating Pen Calibration tests which can be used to select the most accurate nib size for "Rescale to Pen Width". Choose a suitable Nib Size range for the pen you wish to test and then plot the test. Then set your Pen Width for future plots with that pen to the highest nib size which has no gaps between the lines.
    - 'Nib Size Min' - The smallest nib size to test
    - 'Nib Size Max' - The largest nib size to test
    - 'Test Count' - The number of tests to run between the Min/Max nib size
    - 'Rotation' - Controls the angle of the lines in the generated line tests
    - 'Line Tests' - Generates simple hatches line tests
    - 'Circle Tests' - Generates concentric circle tests
    - 'Test Size' - The width/height in mm of each nib size test
    - 'Spacing X/Y' - The grid spacing in mm between each test in the grid
    - 'SVG Font' - The SVG Font to use to draw the labels for each nib size test
    - 'Title' - An optional title to draw at the top of page, you can leave this blank to have no title.
    - 'Font Size' - The height in mm of the label/title text.
- Added: **New Image Filter "Custom Overlay"** - import Black & White image overlays to create new unique styles!
- Added: **New PFM Setting - 'Draw Outlines'** - Draws the outlines of the shapes generated by Mosaic PFMS, great for creating more stylised results!
- Added: **CMYK Offset Settings** & **CMYK Display Settings** - Controlled in the "Configure" panel, Offset settings allow you to slightly offset each colour channel, display settings allow you to control the opacity of the pens, it will automatically update the colour of the pens and re-draw the drawing (this is a on-screen change only).
- Added: **LP Space** - A new shape type available in Voronoi Shapes / Adaptive Shapes / LBG Shapes - it roughly imitates the LP Space/p-norm function to create shapes which vary from Diamond -> Circle -> Rounded Square. This shape type can better represent the tonality of the original image by adjusting its shape to match. It also produces more variety in the final drawing.
- Added: **New Special Pens: Original Colour (Inverted),  Original Grayscale (Inverted)** - Samples the original colour of the source image and inverts it, for use with Digital Only outputs. Great for creating stylised Digital Drawings on a black background.
- Added: "Distortion" setting to all Dashes PFMs
- Added: "Clarity" setting to Sketch PFMs, which increases sharpness and detail in the final output, behind the scenes this effectively adds a Unsharp Mask Filter too the image before processing.
- Improved: Drawing Pen presets now be created easily with "New Preset" - you can select from existing categories and choose a colour
- Improved: Setting pop up windows for Colour Separation / Image Filters / Presets have been improved and standardised
- Improved: Console/Error Logging - log files will now be exported to the Config Folder / Logs, the last 10 logs will be retained
- Improved: Circular Scribbles curve quality
- Fixed: Projects with multiple versions creating massive project files which may fail to load.
- Fixed: Mosaic PFMs not responding in some situations
- Fixed: Batch Processing now supports SVG Files and all Image File types.

- Fixed: Spiral PFMs crashing with Colour Match enabled
- Fixed: Checkboxes in the Drawing Pen dropdown not updating properly when pens are removed/added.

### [v1.5.2-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.5.2-beta-free)
- Added: **7 NEW PFMS**
  - **Spiral Circular Scribbles:** creates a spiral made of one continuous circular scribble
  - **Hatch Sawtooth:** creates a series of parallel wavy lines to represent an image, the lines are connected at each end, to form one continous line.
  - **Hatch Circular Scribbles:** creates a series of parallel circular scribbles to represent an image, the lines are connected at each end, to form one continous line.
  - **Adaptive Letters:** similar to Adaptive Shapes but instead uses letters from included SVG Fonts (it can also use regular fonts)
  - **Voronoi Letters:** similar to Adaptive Letters but distributes the letters with a Weighted Voronoi Diagram instead
  - **Mosaic Segments:** Generates a mosaic out of detailed segments using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering, the shapes it generates represent the shapes present in the original drawing much more accurately that Mosaic Voronoi.
  - **Mosaic Triangulation:** Generates a mosaics out of triangulation generated via Delaunay Triangulation.
- Added: **"Hatch Fill" options to SVG Converter** - which will allow DrawingBotV3 to convert many more SVG types, and generate fills for solid shapes which can easily be drawn by a pen plotter.
  - "Shape Clipping" - When enabled Solid Shapes will "clip" the shapes below, meaning if a shape is covered by another in the SVG only the visible part will be drawn, this only occurs for solid shapes, individual lines won't clip the shapes below.
  - "Shape Filling" - When enabled Hatch Fills will be generated
  - "Spacing" - The distance between the hatch lines, it is relative to the pen width so a spacing of 1.0 will draw over the entire shape with no gaps, a spacing of 2.0 will leave spaces the same width as the pen.
  - "Min/Max Rotation" - Controls the rotation of the generated hatch lines
  - "Link Ends" - Links the resulting hatch lines to create one continous line (for some shapes this may not always be possible)
  - "Crosshatch" - Creates an additional set of perpendicular Hatch Lines
- Added: **New Erasing Settings for Sketch PFMS**, these allow the creation of new styles, specifically ones which can be drawn more easily with a single pen. The following settings have been added.
  These settings replace "Adjust Brightness", you can think of "Erase Min" and "Erase Max" as the "Adjust Brightness range", using the same erase min & max is the same as setting "Adjust Brightness" in previous versions.
  Using a Erase Radius Min & Erase Radius Max of 1.0 will produce the same results as previous versions. The radius allows you to control the spacing of lines in a way which wasn't possible before.
  - Erase Min: the minimum intensity of the erase process
  - Erase Max: the maximum intensity of the erase process
  - Erase Radius Min: the minimum radius of the erased shape
  - Erase Radius Max: the maximum radius of the erased shape
  - Tone: controls the contrast of the erase processs, using a higher Tone will result in a image with a stronger contrast in the spacing of lines. The tone slider has no effect when the Erase Range values are identical.
- Added: **New PFM Presets**
  - Sketch Lines ("Digital", "Sharp Lines", "Micro Detail")
  - Adaptive Dashes ("Vertical Lines", "Horizontal Lines", "Needles")
  - Adaptive Circular Scribbles ("Sketchy")
  - Adaptive Shapes ("Overlapping Squares", "Overlapping Circles")
- Added: **"Exported Drawing" display mode**, this will show the last set of files exported, you can select a recent exported file.
  - It shows the difference in the following stats after path optimization, "Shapes", "Total Travel", "Distance Down", "Distance Up", "Pen Lifts" and also each pen it's respective distance travelled.
  - By default when you export a vector file the "Exported Drawing" display mode will be shown, you can disable this in File / Preferences / Export Settings / General
- Added: Splash Screen, which displays while DBV3 is loading.
- Added: New "Contrast" & "Brightness" settings to Adaptive PFMs, Adaptive PFMS rely on good contrast in the original image, so now a initial level of contrast is applied, the default is currently "1.25", setting this too "1.00" will result in the same results as previous versions
- Added: "Align Rotation" setting to Adaptive Shapes, this will cause the shapes generated to follow the natural contours of the image, when enabled you won't be able to set "Min" & "Max" rotation
- Added: "Point Density" to Voronoi PFMs - this new options allows you to specify a density of points which is relative to the drawings dimensions, instead of matching a arbitary point count ( you can still use a point count with the "Point Limit" option) i.e. a A4 and A3 drawing with the same density would have a similar about of points in a given area
- Added: "Ignore White" option to Voronoi PFMs, when enabled the PFM will try to avoid creating shapes in white ares of the image.
- Added: 'Spiral Type' setting to Spiral Sawtooth (previously named Spiral PFM)
  - "Archimedean" - The default / original Spiral.
  - "Parabolic" - Two connected spirals / Fermat Spiral
- Added: "Invert" button to Mask Settings.
- Added: "Auto Run PFM" - this will automatically re-run the PFM when you change any settings or when you change the current PFM, you can disable this in File/Preferences/General/Auto Run PFM
- Added: "Select", "Edit", and "Draw" Modes too Masking Settings to allow the customisation of Masking and drawing custom masks with lines / bezier curves
- Added: "Soft Clip" option to Masking Settings - when this is enabled PFMs will naturally overlap over the edges of the mask rather than clipping the shape exactly at the border.
- Added: "Square Tiles" option to Mosaic Rectangles, when enabled the PFM will only create square tiles, when enabled "row count" and "row padding" will be disabled
- Improvement: **Speed Improvements for Adaptive PFMs**, up to 3x faster on larger images.
- Improvement: **Speed Improvements for Sketch PFMs**
- Improvements: The quality of the output from Adaptive Circular Scribbles has been greatly improved and the default preset will now perform much better and result in a more consistent circular scribble quality.
- Improvement: Increased the rendering speed of the viewport, changes to pen colours and shape ranges will be much more reponsive.
- Improvement: Renamed mask buttons from "Bypass Mask" & "Show Masks" too "Enable Masking" and "Display Masks"
- Improvement: Masking - when zooming in the masks edges will now remain 1px wide to allow more precise positioning.
- Improvement: Masking - you can now more masks using the arrow keys.
- Improvement: Using the "Reset" and "Randomise" options on category headings in PFM Settings will now affect all the settings in the category.
- Improvement: The shape / vertice count will now update with the shapes slider
- Fixed: Original Sampling Pens (Original Colour, Original Grayscale etc.)

- Fixed: Issue where sometimes the Pen Distribution would not update properly.
- Fixed: Issue where Sketch Waves would freeze and not complete in some situations.
- Fixed: Adaptive TSP path linking accuracy (results in less overlapping lines)
- Fixed: Reduced the impact of several background processes

### [v1.5.1-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.5.1-beta-free)
- Added: 'Voronoi Style' option to Adaptive Voronoi, Voronoi Diagram & Mosaic Voronoi.
  - "Classic" - The default and original Voronoi Diagram
  - "Smooth" - A smoother version of the original
  - "Sharp" - A more jagged / stylised version
  - "Offset A, B, C" - Less detailed / stylised version using the different offsets of adjacent triangles
- Added: "Smooth Distribution" option to Colour Match, this option will result in a more even usage of different pen colours which will rely less on Black & the canvas colour.
- Added: Reset UI button to the "View" menu

  - Export Settings: This is the new home for all your usual Export Settings.
  - NOTE: Search Function is currently limited, but will search settings individually too.
- Added: **'Directionality', 'Distortion', 'Angularity', 'Edge Power', 'Sobel Power', 'Luminance Power' and 'Squiggle Min Length'** to All Sketch PFMs
  - Directionality - forces the lines to follow the natural contours of the image
  - Distortion - adds some noise to the generated lines, creating more stylised images.
  - Angularity - higher angularity results in lines which don't change direction as frequently, resulting in more sweeping curves in curve pfms
  - Edge Power - used to exaggerate key edges in the image
  - Sobel Power - used to exaggerate a cartoonish quality for the plot
  - Luminance Power - typically PFMs will follow dark areas in the image when creating lines, this slider can be used to decrease the influence of brightness which in turn will favour other style options like Directionarity or Edge Power etc.
  - Squiggle Min Length - prevents incredibly short squiggles from being created, shortening plotting times - thanks to HanzPetrov
- Added: "Connected Lines" - Option to Spiral PFM - creating one continuous polyline for the spiral, massively reducing the amount of pen lifts required.

- Fixed: Export per/n pens being too large on some screens and made the window resizable.
- Fixed: Removed erroneous pen 222 from Staedtler 36 pen pack - led 

### [v1.4.1-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.4.1-beta-free)
- Added: **Colour Match - Premium Only** - A new Colour Seperation mode for Sketch PFMs only, it will compare the pens in your drawing set to the colours in the image and when drawing will try to use the best matched pen.
  You also have a few options to configure colour match further, found to the right of the Colour Seperation drop-down.
  
  - "Colour Accuracy" - Decreasing the Colour Accuracy will lower the quality of the colour match and allows pens to draw over areas where they have a higher colour difference. Colour Accuracy relates to a Delta-E colour measurement in the following way
    - 100: No colour difference
    - 99: Slight colour difference     
    - 98: Small colour difference     
    - 97: Medium colour difference
    - 96: Large colour difference
    - 95: Very large colour difference
  
  - "Brightness Multiplier" - Decreases the overlap of the pens in the image
  - "Pen Limit" - Limits the number of pens which can be used when matching, if this value is set to 18, only the 18 best matched pens will be used. If this value is set to 0, there is no limit.
  - "Use Canvas Colour" - Adds an invisible pen which matches the colour of the Canvas, helps to avoid drawing unnecessary lines.    
  - "Line Density - from Sketch PFMs" - the line density control found in the Sketch PFMs can also be used to control the Colour Match output.
  - **For the best results**
    - Use all the pens of a specific manufacturer, i.e. Use the presets for the set of 60 Staedtler Fineliners, then use the Pen Limit feature, to limit selection to approx 18+ pens allowing colour match to choose your best matched pens for each plot.
    - Use a bright, saturated image, murky images or ones with a limited colour palette will perform poorly.    
- Added: **SVG Import & SVG Converter PFM - Premium Only**
  - You can now import SVGs generated in other softwares or in DrawingBotV3, this opens up many possibilities, such as SVG cropping, rotation, flipping, masking, pen/layer reassignment, layering multiple SVGs and recovering old DBV3 projects. Note: Any text in the SVGs will be blank, you should use "Object to Path" in Inkscape before importing SVGs with text.
  - SVGs can be also be treated like any other image allowing them to be run through any PFM, they will be rasterised at the highest quality possible before plotting (the image tab will show a low quality preview of the SVG).
  - You can control the conversion process in the new PFM SVG Converter, it has a few settings.
      - SVG Path: The path to the SVG to be used, if this isn't set it will use the current imported SVG, if there isn't one the PFM will produce no output. You can however use this PFM as part of a Layers PFM, to layer SVGs together, when you run the PFM like this you can set the SVG Path to use an SVG which hasn't been imported.
      - Derive Drawing Set: When enabled DrawingBotV3 will generate a new Drawing Pen for each colour in the SVG, allowing you to access them each as layers. This opens up possibilities for splitting SVGs by colour using a per/layer export, or even re-assigning colours to your SVG, once the SVG Converter PFM has been run you'll have access to change the colour of lines with all the tools available with a default drawing.
  - You can also import an SVG to run through a standard PFM
 
- Added: **Masking - Premium Only** - A new useful settings tab, to allow you to mask areas of the image, you can add shapes masks such as Rectangles and Circles, you can move, resize, rotate, skew with the controls in the viewport area. You can also import SVGs as masks, they will keep their original sizing so you can create detailed masks by importing an SVG with the same dimensions as in drawing area controls.
- Added: **Image Cropping** - You can now crop images in the Image Processing tab, this allows you to enter values in pixels for cropping the image. You can also hit the "Edit" button and this will display a resizable box in the viewport area which you can then move to create the desired crop. You can also access this cropping feature via the new Display Mode "Image Cropping".
- Added: **Rulers Overlays** - There are now rulers on the borders of the viewport area to show you an accurate scale of your drawing / image.
- Added: Lock 1:1 button to the viewport toolbar, to allow viewing drawings at the correct scale relative to the screen, useful for evaluating the density of your plot.
- Added: Reference Image exports - You can now export the edited reference image used in your plots, via Export / Export Reference Image File.
- Added: Winsor & Newton ProMarkers, Pens/Drawing Sets - led
- Added: Bic Cristal and Intensity, Pens/Drawing Sets - led
- Added: Staedtler Fineliner 305 Sky Blue - Pen Definition - led  
- Added: Support for Googles WebP Image Files (.webp)
- Added: Fullscreen Mode, you can enable it be going to View/Fullscreen Mode
- Added: Frame Hold Start and Frame Hold End to Animation Settings
- Changed: Increased default render quality in the viewport to x4 the previous quality
- Changed: You can now send any file type via the Serial Connection, allowing for sending GCode files to compatible plotters.
- Changed: Image Rotation / Flipping is now Image Specific, when you load a new image these values will be reset.
- Fixed: Drawings/Images flickering when switching Display Modes.
- Fixed: Serial Connection commands will now be executed properly on non-HPGL devices.
- Fixed: Staedtler Fineliner 63 Delft Blue - Pen Definition - led
- Fixed: Export Directory being used instead of Import Directory when importing files - led
- Fixed: Removed duplicate Copic Black Pens - led
- Fixed: "Original Sizing" preset not activating properly  
- Fixed: GCode Settings not saving properly
- Fixed: HP-GL Padding/Offsets creating inaccurate drawings outside of the HP-GL bounds
- Fixed: When exporting with N/Pens the render order will now be used rather than the export order, meaning the order will now match the generated HPGL files correctly.

### [v1.4.0-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.4.0-beta-free)

Note: This update has kept growing and growing, and it’s time it was released, this is a Public Beta, although it has already been through an alpha testing phase.
- Added: New 9 new PFMS
    - **Adaptive Circular Scribbles (Beta)** – this is an implementation of Chiu Et Al 2015, “Tone‐ and Feature‐Aware Circular Scribble Art” – it generates one continuous circular scribble to represent the image. If you wish to achieve results similar to Chiu Et Al’s implementation use a size of paper, pen width which gives you a plotting size of 4000px on the largest edge then use the “Chiu Et Al – 4000px” preset
    - **Adaptive Shapes, Triangulation, Tree (Beta), Stippling, Dashes, Diagram, Adaptive TSP**, are all very similar to their Voronoi counterparts but give a much better representation of the tonality of the input image, they are also typically faster to run.
    - **Voronoi Dashes**, this variation of the new Adaptive Dashes PFM, but using the original Voronoi style.

- **Using Adaptive PFMS**
    - They love high resolution, high contrast images.
    - They are called "Adaptive" because they adapt to match the tone of the input image. This means the reproductions of tones is way more accurate then other PFMs, this means they have an additional processing stage "Tone Mapping". This process only needs to be performed once per configuration of settings, if you change a setting which could alter the tone map it will run again.
    - You can view the output of the tone mapping stage by selecting "Display:" and then "Tone Map", this shows you three outputs the Reference Tone Map, the drawing created by the PFM with the current settings and the blurred version of this output. If your blurred output reassembles the reference tone map v closely that's very good and if you find one which matches better then the current Adaptive Circular Scribbles settings let me know. If the tone map doesn't reassembly the image very closely don't worry DrawingBotV3 will account for this variance to create an image which better matches the tone map anyway.
- Added: Ability to have multiple Drawing Sets, you can then use different sets for each layer/tile in Layers PFM / Mosaic PFM.
    - Drawings Sets can be created and edited from the Pen Settings tab.
- Added: Colour Picker option when right clicking a Drawing Pen, then right-click anywhere in the viewport to set the pen’s colour.
- Added: Settings panels can now be undocked, and moved around independently, they can be re-docked by closing the window it hitting the link button again.
- Added: “Per/Group” export option, when using PFM Layers or any Mosaic PFM this option will export the individual layers/tiles individually
- Added: “Per N/Pens” export option, to allow drawings with multiple pens to be split into a certain number of pens. Useful when exporting for Vintage Plotters which have automatic pen changes.
- Added: “Layer Distribution” option to PFM Layers, which allows finer control over the distribution of pens between layers
    - NONE: Layers will be distributed seperately.
    - ORDERED PER PFM: Layers which use the same PFM and Drawing Set will be distributed together, treating the first layer as the darkest and the last layer as the brightest.
    - ORDERED: Same as the above, but only matches Drawing Sets
- Added: “Clipping Mode”, available in the Drawing Area, allows you to choose if shapes should overflow the edges of the drawing/page or not, this will only have an effect on some PFMS, as some PFMS only work within the image provided anyway. You have three options 
    - “Drawing” – Clip the geometries to the drawings edges
    - “Page” – Clip the geometries to the page’s edges
    - “None” – Allow geometries to overflow the page and drawing
- Added: Portrait/Landscape toggle to the Drawing Area to replace the “Rotate” button, this will remember the orientation you have chosen and keep this orientation when you select a new paper size.
- Improved: Voronoi PFMs are now multi-threaded and also have a new slider “Voronoi Accuracy”, an accuracy of 100% is the equivalent to the previous version 
- Improved: The OpenGL Renderer will now render while the drawing is being generated, the UI will also be much more responsive when it’s updating.
- Changed: When editing Drawing Sets while using Layers PFM / Mosaic PFM they will now live update without having to run the PFM again.
- Changed: Moved “Blend Mode” from Pen Settings to be above the Viewport
- Changed: Moved “Colour Seperation” to be part of Pen Settings
- Changed: Pen settings buttons Add/Remove/etc. now use symbols instead of text and have tool tips when hovered, to try and re-clutter the UI.
- Changed: If you open a project and DrawingBotV3 is unable to locate the original image used you will now be prompted to locate the image.
- Changed: The recommended Distribution Type will now be change based on the current settings.
- Changed: DrawingBotV3 will now remember the PFMs “preconfigured” distribution, so when creating drawings with CMYK seperation the distribution will not be forgotten when you switch back.
- Fixed: Some pop-up windows not closing when the main window is closed.
- Fixed: Mosaic PFMs and Layers PFM will now show their current progress properly.
- Fixed: Voronoi PFMs will now show their current progress properly.
- Fixed: HPGL Exports not having the correct offset
- Fixed: GCode Settings not loading correctly when switching presets
- Fixed: Custom version names not being saved with the project

- Note: The recommended JAVA version for DBV3 is now Java 17.
- Note: All packaged installers now use a Java 17 Runtime instead of Java 11
- Added: Sketch Waves PFM, another Sketch PFM variation which uses Sin/Cos/Tan waves to direct the sketched lines, it's in Beta (Premium Only)
- Added: Sketch Layers, allows you to layer the results on multiple PFMS on top of each other and optionally pass the lightned image between them to create new unique styles (Premium Only), thanks to HanzPetrov for all his hardwork on this!
- Added: Projects saved will now store the current drawing state, allowing you to reload projects exactly where you left off. Versions will also store the drawing state, so you can switch between variations instantly. (Premium Only)

    - Also including monitoring of the Progress, Bytes Sent, Elapsed Time, Remaining Time and the Plotters own buffer.
    - Sending can also be paused when needed and resumed.
    - Ability to detect the plotter being used and apply the recommended settings!
    - The serial port connection runs in a seperate thread so you can continue using DrawingBot while your Drawing is plotting.
    - It can also be used to send files not generated with DrawingBot and in fact will stream any .txt file over the serial port!

### [v1.1.0-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.1.0-stable)
- Added: Three New Path Finding Modules Mosaic Custom, Voronoi Tree and Voronoi TSP.
  - "Mosaic Custom" - Allows you to create your own Custom Mosaic, using an image mask. 
    This opens up many creative possibilities combining the effects of multiple PFMs to create more complex pieces. 
    This is very easy to do, you first need to create an image mask in an image editor which has the same resolution as the original image which contains a unique block colour for each drawing style you plan to use.
    Then you can import this mask as one of the settings, and for each Drawing Style define a "Mask Colour" which matches the one you used in the mask image.
    You can also feather the mask in the settings.
  - "Voronoi Tree" - Creates a "Minimum Spanning Tree" using Prim's algorithm, using the points generated from a Weighted Voronoi Diagram, it creates artwork similar to the classic TSP art but in a fraction of the time.
  - "Voronoi TSP" - Creates a solution to the "Travelling Salesman Problem" for the points generated from a Weighted Vornoi Diagram, if you're serious about using this PFM with a high point count expect to wait many hours or days to get the final result, optimisations are very welcome! 
    There are currently 3 algorithms, a Lazy 2-Opt Approach which is very fast and inaccurate, then an implementation of the classic Lin-Kernighan, and an attempt to implement the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm. 2-Opt is the most stable and the one I recommend.
- Added: CMYK Configuration, next to the colour seperation drop-down you now have the option to configure the weighting of the CMYK plot to allow you to fine tune the density to your specific pens, as many users reported their K layer being too strong, the default for K is now x0.75. This option works with every PFM.
- Added: Video Exporting for Animations in both H.264 and ProRes 422.
- Changed: "Randomise" will now produce more stable results and should be able to run in most instances
- Changed: The min/max of a few key variables have been changed.
- Changed: Values can now be set outside of the range of the min/max for more advanced users, in some instances this may cause the plot to crash or not start at all.
- Changed: Some PFMs which had optimisation disabled by default will now have as a minimum geometry sorting enabled to reduce plotting times
- Changed: Mosaics now optimise the outputs of each tile individually to speed up optimisation times.
- Changed: Raster export dimensions will now be multiples of 2

- Fixed: PNG export accuracy, they will now match the JPG exports and only be transparent if the blend mode is "Normal".
- Fixed: Image Rendering / Image Sequence Rendering - Rendering will now be more accurate when using blend modes or CMYK seperation
- Fixed: Image Sequence Rendering - Fixes a rare glitch where random lines may appear on an animation.
- Fixed: Rare bug where Colour Sampling in curve modes would result in the final line being completely transparent.

### [v1.0.15-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.15-stable)
- Added: Two New Path Finding Modules for creating Mosaics!
    - "Mosaic Rectangle" - Creates a mosaic of rectangles out of a set of user configurable styles.
    - "Mosaic Voronoi" - Creates a mosaic based on the output of a weighted Voronoi Diagram from a set of user configurable styles.
    - The "User Configurable styles" can have a "weighting" to affect their distribution, there is no limit on the number of different styles per mosaic.
    - Please note: Using Voronoi PFMs for drawing styles can be tempremental.
- Added: Version Control! You can now save your favourite versions of your project as you go and experiment with settings without losing your favourites.
    - There is a "Save Version" button next to the plotting controls, click this when you create something you like, you can then access and reload / save these versions from the "Version Control" panel, which will show a preview of the version the date it was created and the name of the path finding module used.
- Added: Project Loading & Saving! 
    - You can now save your projects and reload them as ".drawingbotv3" files from the "File Menu" - you can also save versions in this way.
    - This saves all elements of the project, like Drawing Size, PFM Settings, Pen Settings & also all of the versions you've created!
    - It doesn't however save the image used to keep the files small but it will save the path to the image used and reload it if it's still available. 
- Fixed: Default presets become replicated when saving new presets.

### [v1.0.13-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.13-stable)
- Added: Four New Path Finding Modules! All of which use much more accurate "Bresenham" calculations this results in longer processing times.
    - "Sketch Quad Beziers" - Builds the image out of the darkest quadratic curves. By first finding the darkest line and finding the darkest control point.
    - "Sketch Cubic Beziers" - Builds the image out of the darkest cubic curves. By first finding the darkest line, and then finding the darkest combination of control both points.
    - "Sketch Catmull-Roms" - Builds the image out of the darkest catmull-rom splines. This works by finding the best possible curve over the next two segments.
    - "Sketch Shapes" - Builds the image out of either Squares of Ellipses.
  
- Changed: The original "Sketch Curves PFM" has had a major revamp and now works almost as well as Catmull Roms, however it uses more basic Bresenham calculations so has a reduced accuracy, but does result in a much faster processing time.
- Fixed: An issue where when hitting "Reset View", it sometimes had to be hit again.
- Fixed: An issue where zooming would behave in strange ways.
- Fixed: Issue where either the last or first shape wasn't drawn, primarily in curve modes.
