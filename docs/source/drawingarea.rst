Drawing Area
======================

In this settings panel you can configure the output size of your drawing. If you're output is for print for the best results you should enter paper size / pen width to allow DrawingBotV3 to optimise the drawing for plotting.

All changes you make to the drawing size will be automatically update the preview rendered when the "Display Mode" is set to "Image".

There are a number of presets already included which cover typical paper sizes, you can also create you own presets.

- **Use Original Sizing:** If the original images size should be used, recommended for digital only output, not recommended for print only outputs.
- **Input Units:** To specify the units for the width/height/padding, either mm, cm, inches
- **Width:** The width of the drawing area, in the current Input Units.
- **Height:** The height of the drawing area, in the current Input Units.
- **Padding:** The margins of the drawing area, in the order Left/Right/Top/Bottom, in the current Input Units.
- **Scaling Mode:** How to rescale the image to fit into the new dimensions, this resizing occurs before pre-processing so will still be optimised to the paper size / pen width

  - Crop to fit
  - Scale to fit
  - Stretch to fit

- **Rescale to Pen Width**: when activated the image will be rescaled to the specified "pen width".
- **Pen Width (mm)**: the nib size to be used when plotting, if you are using multiple sizes often the average of all sizes will give the best result or the most used size.
